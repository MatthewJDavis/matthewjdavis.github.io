# Overview

I have recently passed the [Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator certification] exam and wrote this post to list some of the useful resources that I used to pass this exam.

Microsoft are updating their exams more regularly to meet the ever changing services and practices that the cloud brings at a fast pace so it is always best to download the exam objectives from the [official site] and studied to build a plan to pass the exam.

When I took the exam it was broken down:

* Implement an identity management solution (25-30%)  
* Implement an authentication and access management solution (25-30%)
* Implement access management for apps (10-15%)
* Plan and implement an identity governance strategy (25-30%)

## Microsoft Learning

First stop should be the Microsoft Learning course which is a free online learning platform created by Microsoft that has a lot of good information pertaining to the topics covered in the Exam. At time of taking the exam and writing this, there were not 3rd party courses provided to teach the content. The learning path is broken down into 4 modules (this may change in the future):

[SC-300 part 1: Implement an identity management solution]
[SC-300 part 2: Implement an Authentication and Access Management solution]
[SC-300 part 3: Implement Access Management for Apps]
[SC-300 part 4: Plan and implement an identity governance strategy]

## YouTube

### By John Savill

John's videos on YouTube are great, complex topics are explained clearly along with examples. Highly recommended watching for all things Azure, PowerShell and more. Check out his [channel].

* [Azure Master Class Part 2 - Identity]
* [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) - AZ-500, SC-300 Deep Dive Topic]
* [Azure AD App Registrations, Enterprise Apps and Service Principals]
* [Access Reviews Deep Dive - AZ-500/SC-300]

### By Mark Grimes

I found Mark's videos the night before the exam and they are great, nice and concise with lots of good points and tips. Recommend to check them out sooner because he has lots of links and tips to dig deeper into the exam topics.

* [SC-300 Module 1 Implement an Identity Management Solution]
* [SC-300 Module 2 Implement an Authentication and Access Management Solution]
* [SC-300 Module 3 Implement Access Management for Apps]
* [SC-300 Module 4 Plan and implement an Identity Governance Strategy]

## Pluralsight

If you have access to Pluralsight, the following courses are worth a watch.

* [Design Authorization for Microsoft Azure]
* [Design Authentication for Microsoft Azure]
* [Design Auditing for Microsoft Azure]
* [Design Governance and Identity Management in Microsoft Azure]
* [Microsoft Azure Administrator: Preparing for the AZ-104 Exam] (Useful tips for exam day).

## Documentation

### Azure AD concepts

Reading through the documentation is a great way to prepare for the exam and helps get comfortable with how the services work, different options that can be configured and how to implement and monitor. The Microsoft Learn modules have links to relevant documentation throughout the course and below are some links to documentation I read through a couple of times.

* [Main Azure AD documentation]
* [MFA]
* [Privilege Identity Management]
* [Azure AD Service limits] (Good to review how nested groups work with certain services in Azure AD)
* [What is Azure AD connect?]
* [Connect Azure AD to Sentinel]
* [Administrative Units]
* [Conditional Access]
* [Security Defaults]
* [Visual of services and licenses]: https://m365maps.com/EMS%20Enterprise.htm

### Azure PowerShell

It's good to know some PowerShell for the exam and how the Azure Modules work, enough so you can understand what is going on in a basic script.

[Azure PowerShell]
[Older MSOL module]
[MSGraph PowerShell module]

### General concepts

* [The four pillars of identity management]
* [How SAML authentication works]
* [What’s the Difference Between OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML?]
* [An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect]


## Hands on learning

This is the way I love to cement what I learned via watching and reading and I highly recommend getting a free Azure subscription to get hands on with the services. Once you have your free subscription, you can get a 90 day trial for P2 licenses and then another 90 day trial for EMS E5 licenses to get the full Azure AD experience and features to try out.

I have had my Azure AD and Azure subscription a number of years now but had not activated the trial until studying for the exam and that gave me the chance to configure conditional access, PIM and all the other nice features you get with a p2 license.

I set up an AD environment in my Azure subscription and configured an Azure AD connect server to go over the different hybrid scenarios and felt this exercise is not only worth while for the exam but also for real world experience.

Configuring an application and deploying it to a free tier in Azure then registering it with Azure Applications and applying conditional access policies was also another valuable bit of work I carried out. It was great to see how it worked when I had configured Seamless single sign on and logging in with my test user to a domain joined machine how smooth the process was.
