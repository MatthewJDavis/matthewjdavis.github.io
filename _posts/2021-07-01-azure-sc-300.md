# Overview

I have recently passed the [Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator certification] exam and wrote this post to list some of the useful resources that I used to pass this exam.

Microsoft are updating their exams more regularly to meet the ever changing services and practices that the cloud brings at a fast pace so it is always best to download the exam objectives from the [official site] and studied to build a plan to pass the exam.

When I took the exam it was broken down:

* Implement an identity management solution (25-30%)  
* Implement an authentication and access management solution (25-30%)
* Implement access management for apps (10-15%)
* Plan and implement an identity governance strategy (25-30%)

## Microsoft Learning

First stop should be the Microsoft Learning course which is a free online learning platform created by Microsoft that has a lot of good information pertaining to the topics covered in the Exam. At time of taking the exam and writing this, there were not 3rd party courses provided to teach the content. The learning path is broken down into 4 modules (this may change in the future):

[SC-300 part 1: Implement an identity management solution]
[SC-300 part 2: Implement an Authentication and Access Management solution]
[SC-300 part 3: Implement Access Management for Apps]
[SC-300 part 4: Plan and implement an identity governance strategy]
