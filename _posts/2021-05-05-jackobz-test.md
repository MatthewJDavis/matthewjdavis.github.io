To illustrate both the current and future impact of the COVID19 pandemic on Europeâ€™s economy I have created an online dashboard to retrieve and analyse the latest available 
economic data for the region. The application, which uses the R library Shiny, downloads the latest available data on a weekly basis and includes a series of interactive charts and graphics.
