I use VSTS to create test projects and demo projects then have a clean up every now and then but sometimes forget how to delete the project.. can you delete it from within the project itself or elsewhere? I forgot. This quickie will remind me in the future when I've not deleted a project in a while and have forgotten (hopefully the interface won't have changed too drastically then, it's updated on such a fast cycle there's always something new to discover!).

Go to the main account settings

## click on the VSTS icon (top right)

In the settings icon, select projects??

Click on the project

Select delete


Confirm the deletion by typing in the name of the project (you must be sure.... this action is not reversable!!)

Easy when you know how!
