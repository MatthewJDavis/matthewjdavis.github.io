## Chocolatey for softare installation

I seem to be back on the Windows track at work and at home, after a spell away learning AWS and doing lots of work with Ubuntu linux. I've been ticking over with PowerShell but definitely platued a bit, mainly learning and using AWS cmdlets but not really scripting and it's funny how some of the knowledge gained over the last few years has slipped to the back of the brain.. so it's time to get back into PowerShell, Windows and taking a good look at Chocolatey package manager (after using apt-get in Ubuntu so much, I've used Chocolatey a bit in the past but want to learn deeper about the project and technology and who knows... might even bring back some of those rooted away PowerShell skills!).

Chocolatey what is it?!

Usefull commands

Package Repos

Checking packages / security
