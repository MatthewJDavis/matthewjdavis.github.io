# Overview

Below are the details of Microsoft Graph permissions including IDs which are required when using Terraform, PowerShell or Azure CLI.

In my previous article on using [Terraform to deploy to Azure AD], I used the ```required_resource_access``` argument in the Terraform [azuread_application] resource to set the [Microsoft Graph API permissions] for the app being created. One thing that stumped me for a bit was how to get the ID of the permission. This wasn't available on the [Microsoft Graph API permissions] documentation at the time of writing.

Searching showed that you can see the current API grants of an application by the Azure CLI by running:

```bash
 az ad app show --id 
```

This outputs the following section:

```json
  "requiredResourceAccess": [
    {
      "additionalProperties": null,
      "resourceAccess": [
        {
          "additionalProperties": null,
          "id": "7ab1d382-f21e-4acd-a863-ba3e13f7da61",
          "type": "Role"
        }
      ],
      "resourceAppId": "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"
    }
  ],
```

The ```resourceAppId``` in the above snippet is for the Microsoft Graph. [This post] has details of the other application IDs for Microsoft resources. The ```resourceAccess``` ID is for the role **Directory.Read.All** and this is what is displayed in the Azure portal. This was a start but I wanted to know other IDs and this method only showed what was already granted to that app. I couldn't find a way to do this via the Azure CLI or PowerShell.

I ended up finding [this comment] on a GitHub issue that showed how to retrieve the information from the MS Graph by the following query: ```https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals?$filter=appId eq '00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000'&$select=appRoles, oauth2PermissionScopes```.

I created a basic [python cli script] to get this information, format it and output it in a markdown table which is what is below to be used for future reference.

Note: Role permissions display as ```Application``` and scope permissions display as ```Delegated``` in the Azure portal.
