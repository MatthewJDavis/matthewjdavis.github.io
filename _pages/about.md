# Me

Originally from Bath in the UK and now living in Toronto CA and loving it. Like to get out and about on my bike (though I've left it in the UK for now...), go to the gym, kickbox and getting out in the fresh air. I work as an identity and infrastructure engineer, looking after Microsoft Active Directory and various dev tools running on AWS and Azure including Team City, GitHub and JIRA. I like to focus on PowerShell and how to use it to manage infrastructure and automate tasks.

# Blog
This is just a place to keep useful things I learn along the way in this IT game. I have an old wordpress site that I didn't use too often. Using GitHub pages takes away the overhead of managing the WordPress site and I can do everything from my favourite editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
