# Me

I currently live in Bath and like to get out and about on my bike, go to the gym, kickbox and getting out in the fresh air. I work as an identity and infrastructure engineer, looking after Microsoft Active Directory and various dev tools running on AWS and Azure including Team City, GitHub and JIRA. I like to focus on PowerShell and how to use it to manage infrastructure and automate tasks.

# Blog
This is just a place to keep useful things I learn along the way in this IT game. I have an old wordpress site that I didn't use too often. Using GitHub pages takes away the overhead of managing the WordPress site and I can do everything from my favourite editor [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
